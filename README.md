# Lay

Lite PHP Framework to get your project up and running.

PHP Version: `7.4 >`
Current Version: `1.0.0`

## Get Started

1. Ensure you have at least PHP 7.4 installed
2. Copy the *init-lay* file to your server root directory or where you wish to initialize new projects using the command line.
3. Open the script and replace the `$default_lay_location` variable with the path of the Lay package you cloned.
4. To create a new project, open your command line app and type `php init-lay sample-project` or use `php init-lay -h` for help on how to use the script.
5. When the script is done, you can open the project like a regular webserver project. Example: `localhost/sample-project`
